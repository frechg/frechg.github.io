                Redesign and rebuild Blue Sky Broadcasts existing
                business to business product.
              </h2>
              <h3>The Team</h3>
              <p>
                Two rails developers and a project manager from the Blue Sky team, two rails developers
                from the thoughtbot team and myself as the designer.
              </p>
              <p>
                My role as the designer was to lead the interaction design, user experice desing, interface design,
                product design, conduct research and user testing, impliment the application UI and lead the develpers
                so that any feature they work on were already implmented on the front end. I also worked in cordination
                with the Project manager to lead the direction of the redesign/rebuild.
              </p>
              <h3>Develop Understanding</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Understand the solutions, values and outcomes the existing application delivers.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Understand the scope of the existing functionality, what works, what doesn't and why.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Understand the existing customers, their needs and how the current product fulfills or
                    falls short of meeting those needs.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Understand the vision for the product and business so the rebuild can help facilitate
                    the realization of future goals such as delivery of new functionality and acquisition of
                    new customers from untapped markets.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To develop these necessary understandings I conducted interviews with: Blue Sky product managers,
                the Blue Sky CEO, the Blue Sky Sales and Marketing teams, Blue Sky engineers supporting the
                legacy app, internal "Platform Admins" who administer Blue Sky client accounts. I also studied
                as many existing client accounts as I could get access to. I was not allowed to interview or conduct
                tests with existing Blue Sky clients, but doing so would have been extreamly valuable.
              </p>
              <h3>The Legacy App</h3>
              <p>

                industries from architecture and insurace to physics and pharmaceuticals. Blue Sky captures event presentations
                and lectures, archives the content online and delivers online courses created from the captured content to
