Bin is your digital memory. It's the easiest way to save and make use of the things you find online. Use Bin to build a personal knowledge base that you can retrieve, search and generate content from. Itâ€™s a digital memory that is uniquely yours, that can be used for fun and to get things done.

Start building your Bin by syncing your media and screenshots. Add anything else, like a website or a social post by sending it to the Bin app via a share sheet or the native Bin app interface. Bin will do an analysis of the content, add tags for categories and themes, translate images to text, and scrap content out of websites. Thoughts, notes, and todos are also valid inputs and can be included alongside other content.

The magic of Bin is what it enables you to do with your digital memory. In addition to simple search and retrieval, Bin can generate one-off or recurring articles and summaries to help you learn, conduct research or develop ideas. Generating engaging and sharable content on a weekly basis will be important to driving consumer adoption and distribution.

Eventually, you may want to connect your knowledge base to 3rd party services, so that the service can provide you with the most personalized experience possible. You may also eventually want to have this personal data stored on a physical device and backed up on a decentralized cloud, helping to ensure ownership and privacy.
