A software development environment that uses the growing capbilities of AI models to integrate product, design and engineering workflows in a single product. Every step in the software development workflow is currently being rethought with AI, and LLMs are helping non experts learn to build in real time. Software creation is on it's way to looking very different than it does today. As AI gets better at witing code and generating UI, human creators will spend more time specifying solutions and less time implementing them.

The average software creator of the future will be more like a generalist, working across product, desing and engineering roles. Sketches, natural language, and workflow and system diagrams will be the primary tools used to define UIs, data models and application behaviors.

Familier interfaces like terminals, text editors and digital canvases will remain, giving creators full control. The embedded Console AI will have context on the whole project: PRDs, designs, code, and more. The AI can collaborate with the user at any point in their flow and can act as a teacher, helping users learn their way to great solutions.

The mission is to increase access to the value creating power of software.
