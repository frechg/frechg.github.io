A software development environment that integrates product, design and engineering workflows in a single product with an embedded AI, increasing access to the power of software for beginners and accelerating it for experts. Console is a bet that the future of software creation will look very different than it does today and that the software creators of the future will be a new archetype altogether AI automations and augmentations are being applied to almost every part of the software development workflow and LLMs are helping non experts learn to build in real time. Taken together, the average software creator of the future will be more like a generalist that focuses on solution specification rather than detailed implementation. Sketches, workflows, natural language, and system diagrams will be the primary tools used to define UIs, data models and application behaviors. Users will always be able to modify the details and access code via the integrated editor and terminal, and the embedded AI can always help users learn their way out of a problem. The cost to create software is clearly deflating, and Iâ€™m excited to further unlock economic opportunity and creativity by enabling individuals, small teams and experts in other domains to wield greater software power.
