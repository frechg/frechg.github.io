Your personal or family server for messages, email, files, media, crypto storage, local AI, personal AI memory, and participation in network validation with decentralized backup of your data. A new paradigm for personal computing that accelerates digital ownership and builds out the foundation for decentralized systems. HomeNode is a physical device that people secure in their homes. They interact with the HomeNode OS through web and mobile interfaces and can use any app in the HomeNode app store to access and interact with their data. If the future of the digital world is going to be defined by qualities like openness, freedom, ownership, resilience, independence and privacy, and if everyone’s going to be a stakeholder, we’re all going to need a HomeNode.
