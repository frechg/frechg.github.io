A secure server for you and your families digital lives. Back up your files and media on decentralized networks. Self custody your crypto assets. Run personalized AI at home, with secured memory. Publish content and route messaging. Earn passive income by participating in network validation.

HomeNode is a physical device that you keep in your home. Users access the HomeNode OS through web and mobile interfaces and can use 3rd party apps to interact with their node data and programs.

If the future of the digital world is going to be defined by openness, ownership, resilience, independence, and privacy, and if everyone’s going to be a stakeholder, we’re all going to need a HomeNode. A new paradigm for personal computing is coming. The HomeNode mission is to accelerate digital ownership and build out a foundation for the decentralized systems of the future.
