      %span Segment Marketing Site Project - Fall 2015

    %h6 The Challenge
    %p
      Our challenge was to improve the effectiveness of communication on our
      marketing site by starting with a redesign of the Segment home page.
    %p
      Segment sales and support teams where spending a lot of time educating
      customers on what Segment is and isn’t, and it was clear our marketing
      site was not communicating as effectively as it should. Poor conversion
      rates from home page to signup page to successful account creation also
      informed our focus.
    %p
      As a young company still working to define its self, the challenges of
      clearly communicating what we are and what our value was went deeper than
      just the marketing site. Internally there where a lot different opinions
      and interviews revealed a wide range of ways in which people explained our
      product.

    %h6 The Solution
    %p
      Working with Carolann Bonner, we began by understanding and internalizing the
      problem. Being less experienced with marketing design, we took time to
      quickly familiarize our selves with relevant strategies for thinking about
      and approaching the problem.
    %p
      Identifying an underlying concept that framed Segment in terms of “data
      access, completeness and correctness” gave us a good starting point. With
      this concept and knowledge of our various customer types, we begin
      diverging on possible solutions.
    %p
      We iterated through many story concepts with internal feedback and began
      to discover themes that enabled us to converge on a smaller set of ideas.
      This exercise also help to influence the development of better alignment
      in the company around how we think about and describe our product.

      Our next step was to take the remaining concepts and build upon them with
      visuals. We used mind-maps and time restricted exercises to quickly
      generate many ideas.

      We quickly prototyped our concepts with the new visuals and got input from
      teammates in various departments. This enabled us to eliminate more ideas
      and focus in on a smaller set of concepts.

      We where ready to refine our ideas and test them with our target audience.
      We built a low fidelity prototype, recruited testers and used Google
      Hangouts to facilitate the test. By sharing a link to a .jpg of our
      prototype and using the screen-sharing functionality we where able to make
      observations and ask questions while the tester remains in their
      environment.

      After four prototype iterations and ~20 testing session we had a final
      version we felt would be a solid starting point for improving the
      communication quality of our marketing site.
