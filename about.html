            I’m a product designer and self taught engineer with 14 years of
            experience working on product at organizations like Segment,
            Intercom, and Dropbox. Most of my work has involved the intersection
            of product and business systems. I’m a generalist, with core
            strengths in learning, systems design, strategy, idea generation and
            big picture thinking. I deliver high-level design and code execution
            with rapid iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to building, I like to be active outdoors, on a bike or
            a board, exploring new environments and leaning new things. I read
            Sci-Fi and history, study economics, finance, and technology. I also
            meditate and exercise consistently and have produced my own
            electronic music.
