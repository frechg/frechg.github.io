A product designer and self taught engineer. I have 14 years of
experience working on products at Dropbox, Intercom, Segment, and thoughtbot. Most of my work has involved the intersection
of product and business systems.

I'm a generalist. My core
strength is my ability to learn and persist. I'm also good with system design and strategy development. People appreciate my abilty to generate ideas and provide a macro perspective. I deliver high-quality execution in design and code, while rapidly iterating.

Iâ€™m from Plattsburgh, NY. I grew up outdoors and playing sports. Music production was a creative outlet. The internet connected me with the world. In college, at RPI, I studied engineering and design. My drive to change the world with technology started then.

I like to be active outdoors: on bikes, surf, and snow. My passion is for learning. I read sci-fi and history, study economics, technology, and geo politics. A consistent meditation practice helps expand my awareness.

### Work highlights
