  <p>
    A product designer and self taught engineer with 14 years of
    experience working on product at organizations like Segment,
    Intercom, and Dropbox. Most of my work has involved the intersection
    of product and business systems. Iâ€™m a generalist, with core
    strengths in learning, systems design, strategy, ideation and
    macro perspectives. I deliver high-quality design and code execution
    with rapid iteration.

  <p>
    In addition to building, I like to be active outdoors, on a bike or
    a board, exploring new environments and leaning new things. I read
    Sci-Fi and history, study economics, finance, and technology. I also
    meditate and exercise consistently and have produced my own
    electronic music.
