              <span>Personal Project - December 2013</span>

            <p>
              A side-project I worked on with Alex Baldwin, Cardless is a professional
              networking app designed to replace business cards and simplify the means
              by which professional connections are captured and stored.
            </p>
            <p>
              Business cards are annoying to carry around, annoying to receive and hang
              onto and when you need them you often donâ€™t have any. Cardless replaces
              the traditional business card transaction with the exchange of an email
              address.
            </p>
            <p>
              At networking events we observed many people capturing new professional
              connections by handing their phones over to others so that they could type
              out their contact info in social networking and email apps. This insight
              prompted us to build a prototype app to test the idea. Bellow are
              screenshots of the functional app built as a responsive web application
              with Ruby on Rails.
