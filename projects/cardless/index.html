              Business cards are annoying. They are annoying to carry around and they
              are annoying to receive and when you need them you often don’t have any.
              Worst of all, every card you hand out becomes obsolete the moment any of
              your information changes. Yet, business cards are a staple in the business
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cardless is a side project that I worked on with Alex Baldwin. It aims to
              help those like myself develop and make use of a strong professional
              network without needing to carry business cards, remember emails or spread
              professional connections across multiple social networks.
            </p>
            <h6>Getting Started</h6>
            <p>
              We began to observe, at professional events, how people chose to transact
              business and contact information. We didn’t see too many business card
              transactions but we did noticed a lot of people handing their phones over
              to others so that they could type out their contact info in various apps.
              A lot of people where choosing to use Twitter, Facebook and email as a
              means of capturing a new professional connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              These observations and
              our dissatisfaction with traditional business cards motivated the creation
              of a an MVP of our Cardless concept. The screenshots below are of a
              responsive web application built with Ruby on Rails.
            </p>
            <h6>How It Works</h6>
            <p>
              Add contacts by entering an email address. If the email address is
              already associated with a Cardless users “card”, that card is added to
              your list of contacts and your “card” is shared with your new contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the “new contact” email you enter is not associated with an existing
              Cardless user, an email sharing your Cardless “card” is sent to that email
              address and the recipient is encouraged to share their contact info by
              filling out the rest of a Cardless "card” that has already been created
              for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, the “placeholder” card that has been created is the card
              that gets added to your contacts list. To make this card useful, until the
              “owner” adds/updates content (at any time in the future),  you can add
              relevant notes.
