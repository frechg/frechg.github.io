              Kinscape enables families to connect through privately shared stories that are saved as  memories to create a living family history.

              I worked with a thoughbot developer and a non-technical client team. My role was to lead product strategy and user research and own the design of the product from concept to final interaction and visual design. I would also impliment all of the product UI.
            </p>
            <p>
              To build a powerful story telling tool we needed to understand story telling in the context of families.
              Through interviews, research and experimentation with prototypes, we
              learned about the ways people share stories, what motivates story
              telling and the things that make it difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Kinscape to work we needed to give all family members the to ability
              to tell great stories with little investment. To do this, we put media
              like videos, images and audio, media that people where already using to
              tell and share stories, at the heart of our story structure. This
              architecture enabled users to put together stories using media like
              building blocks that they could then elaborate on with captions and
              narrative.

              To ensure privacy, stories can only be shared with families youâ€™re a part
              of. In the case captured below the user is not part of a family and has to
              create one in order to share their story.

              The Storyscape is an index of all the stories from all of the families a
              user is a part of. Basic searching, sorting and filtering functionality
              give users the ability to browse and revisit stories as the number of
              stories grows.

              We learned that some people would only tell a story if they knew others wanted to hear it. This insight motivated us
              to build a feature that enabled users to request stories from existing and
              invited family members.
