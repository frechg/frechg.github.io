            <p>
              Kinscape is a family oriented social network that enables families to
              connect through privately shared stories built around videos, images and
              audio. The memories captured in Kinscape create a living family history
              that can be accessed and contributed to by future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              On this project I worked with a thoughbot developer and a non-technical
              client team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kinscape is about story telling and to build a powerful story telling tool
              we needed to deeply understand story telling in the context of families.
              Through interviews, research and experimentation with prototypes, we
              learned about the ways people share stories the things that motivate story
              telling and the things that make it difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Kinscape to work we needed to give all family members the to ability
              to tell great stories with little investment. To do this, we put media
              like videos, images and audio, media that people where already using to
              tell and share stories, at the heart of our story structure. This
              architecture enabled users to put together stories using media like
              building blocks that they could then elaborate on with captions and
              narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inline editing tools and auto saving enabled users to craft their story
              without worrying about loosing work or how it might look once it gets
              shared.

              To ensure privacy, stories can only be shared with families you’re a part
              of. In the case captured below the user is not part of a family and has to
              create one in order to share their story.

              The Storyscape is an index of all the stories from all of the families a
              user is a part of. Basic searching, sorting and filtering functionality
              give users the ability to browse and revisit stories as the number of
              stories grows.

              We had learned through interviews and prior research that some people
              didn’t think that others would be interested in hearing stories from them
              but would be happy to tell them if others asked. This insight motivated us
              to build a feature that enabled users to request stories from existing and
              invited family members. This functionality also acted as customer
              acquisition mechanism.
