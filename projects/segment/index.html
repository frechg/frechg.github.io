              <h2>Segment Marketing Site</h2>
              <span>Fall 2015</span>
            </div>
            <h6>The Challenge</h6>
            <p>
              Our challenge was to improve the effectiveness of communication on our
              marketing site by starting with a redesign of the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Segment sales and support teams where spending excessive amounts time
              educating customers on what Segment is and isn’t, and it was clear our
              marketing site was not doing its job. Poor conversion rates from home page
              to signup page to successful account creation also informed our focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a young company still working to define its self, the challenges of
              clearly communicating what we are and what our value is went deeper than
              just the marketing site. Internally there where a lot different opinions
              and interviews revealed a wide range of ways in which people explained our
              product.
            </p>
            <h6>The Solution</h6>
            <p>
              Working with
              <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/carolanncan">Carolann Bonner,</a>
              we began by understanding and internalizing the problem. We then took time
              to quickly familiarize our selves with relevant strategies for thinking
              about and approaching the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Identifying an underlying concept that framed Segment in terms of “data
              access, completeness and correctness” gave us a starting point. With this
              concept and knowledge of our customers we had gained through “jobs to be
              done” interviews, we begin diverging on possible solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We used feedback from teams internally to iterate on various story
              concepts. Themes started to appear and enabled us to converge on a smaller
              set of ideas. This exercise also help to influence more internal alignment
              how we think about and describe our product.
            </p>

        <div class='project-image group'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <div class='image-wrapper'><img src="/images/segment/copy_iteration_1.jpg" /></div>
            <div class='image-wrapper'><img src="/images/segment/copy_iteration_2.jpg" /></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              Our next step was to take the remaining concepts and build upon them with
              visuals. We used mind-maps and time restricted exercises to quickly
              generate many ideas.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <div class='image-wrapper no-border'><img src="/images/segment/sketching_graphics_1.jpg" /></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              We quickly prototyped our concepts with the new visuals and got input from
              teammates in various departments. This enabled us to eliminate more ideas
              and focus in on a smaller set of concepts.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image'>

        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              After eliminated and converging we where ready to test the remaining ideas
              with our target audience. We built low fidelity prototypes, recruited
              testers and used Google Hangouts to facilitate the tests. By linking to
              JPGs of our prototypes and using the screen-sharing functionality we
              where able to make observations and ask questions while the tester
              remained comfortable in their natural environment.

        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              After four prototype iterations and ~20 testing session we had a final
              version that wasn’t perfect but that we felt would be a solid starting
              point for improving the effectiveness of our communication on our
              marketing site. A lot of what we learned set us up well for the next step
              of making larger architectural changes to the rest of the marketing site.
