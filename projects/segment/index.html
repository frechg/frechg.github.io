              <h2>Segment Marketing Site</h2>
              <span>Fall 2015</span>
            </div>
            <h6>The Challenge</h6>
            <p>
              Our challenge was to improve the effectiveness of communication on our
              marketing site by starting with a redesign of the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Segment sales and support teams were spending excessive amounts of time
              educating customers on what Segment is and isn’t, and it became clear our
              marketing site wasn’t doing its job. Poor conversion rates from home page
              through to successful account creation also informed our focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a young company still working to define itself, the challenges of
              clearly communicating what we are and what our value is went deeper than
              just the marketing site. Internally there were a lot of different opinions
              and interviews revealed a wide range of ways in which people explained our
              product.
            </p>
            <h6>The Solution</h6>
            <p>
              Working with
              <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/carolanncan">Carolann Bonner,</a>
              we began by understanding and internalizing the problem. We then took time
              to quickly familiarize our selves with relevant strategies for thinking
              about and approaching the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Identifying an underlying concept that framed Segment in terms of “data
              access, completeness and correctness” gave us a starting point. With this
              concept and insights gained through “jobs to be done” interviews, we begin
              diverging on possible solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We used feedback from teams internally to iterate on various story
              concepts. Themes started to emerge and enabled us to converge on a smaller
              set of ideas. This exercise also help to influence more internal alignment
              with how we think about and describe our product.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image group'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <div class='image-wrapper'><img src="/images/segment/copy_iteration_1.jpg" /></div>
            <div class='image-wrapper'><img src="/images/segment/copy_iteration_2.jpg" /></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              Our next step was to take the remaining concepts and build upon them with
              visuals. We used mind-maps and time restricted exercises to quickly
              generate many ideas.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <div class='image-wrapper no-border'><img src="/images/segment/sketching_graphics_1.jpg" /></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              We quickly prototyped our concepts with the new visuals and got input from
              teammates in various departments. This enabled us to eliminate more ideas
              and focus in on a smaller set of concepts.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image'>

        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              After eliminating and converging we were ready to test the remaining ideas
              with our target audience. We built low fidelity prototypes, recruited
              testers and used Google Hangouts to facilitate the tests. By linking to
              JPGs of our prototypes and using the screen-sharing functionality we were
              able to make observations and ask questions while the tester remained
              comfortable in their natural environment.

          <div class='inner'>
            <p>
              After four prototype iterations and ~20 testing session we had a final
              version that we felt would be a solid starting point for improving the
              effectiveness of the communication on our marketing site. A lot of what we
              learned set us up for making larger architectural changes to the rest of
              the marketing site.
