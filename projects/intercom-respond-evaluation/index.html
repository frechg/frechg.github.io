            <h6>Context</h6>
            <p>In the spring of 2017, a primary company goal was to make our help desk product, Respond, meet the needs of larger businesses. To achieve this, the Respond product team in Ireland would be adding new features and integrations to Respond. Our team was responsible for the growth of Respond and wondered how we might contribute to this goal.</p>
            <p>Once the product did a better job of meeting the needs of larger businesses, could we make it easier for these businesses to switch to our product?</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Business goal:</strong>
              Sell Respond to larger larger businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User goal:</strong>
              Find the product that best meets their needs.
            </p>
            <h6>Research questions</h6>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>How do CS  managers choose a new Help Desk product?</li>
                <li>What is it like for them to evaluate our product?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h6>The user journey for switching help desks</h6>
            <p>We Interviewed customer support  managers who were looking for a new help desk or had recently switched, and developed a detailed understanding of the user journey for switching help desks.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <p>Observing research participants evaluate our product gave us insight on where we had the most opportunity for improvement, and informed our focus.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <h6>User problem</h6>
            <p>People find it difficult to fully determine whether or not Intercom can meet their help desk requirements.</p>
            <h6>Business problem</h6>
            <p>Difficult product evaluation means fewer people will choose our product over a competitor product.</p>
            <h6>Key user insights</h6>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Evaluation happens mostly inside the product</li>
                <li>People have different prefered methods for evaluation</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h6>Key evaluation challenges</h6>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Unexpected UI and functional differences</li>
                <li>Credit card and trial requirements</li>
                <li>Hard to find all of the features</li>
                <li>Technical setup required</li>
                <li>Poor in-app navigation</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h6>Design challenge</h6>
            <p>How might we enable people to quickly know if Intercom Respond meets their Help Desk requirements?</p>
            <p>Using design sprint techniques, we assessed competitive products and explored possible solutions as a team</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image'>
          <div class='inner'>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='text-wrapper'>
          <div class='inner'>
            <p>I distilled themes from our design sprint into distinct concepts. Below are a few examples.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <h6>Getting buy-in from key stakeholders</h6>
            <p>To get the Respond product team on board with our project, Sean and I traveled to Ireland to meet with the team. To get buy-in we shared insights from our research, got feedback on our concepts and used design sprint exercises to make the team a part of developing solutions.</p>
            <h6>Prototyping and testing</h6>
            <p>We had concepts that addressed different types of people and problems and we wanted to test each of them individually, but we also wanted to see if they could work together as a system.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <h6>Choose your own adventure</h6>
            <p>Proposal: Provide multiple paths for evaluating to accommodate different evaluation preferences.</p>
            <p>We had learned that some people are really motivated to evaluate by diving into the product and exploring on their own. Others prefer to be guided and shown how things work.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='project-image'>

            <h6>Video tour</h6>
            <p>Proposal: Use a video to demonstrate features and workflows, for people who prefer to be shown how a product works.</p>
            <p>In testing our prototype linked to a video with content similar to the video we would make.</p>
          </div>

            <h6>Feature list</h6>
            <p>Proposal: A comprehensive list of features for quick comparison against a list of requirements.</p>
            <p>This would also provided a path for those who prefer to start evaluation by reading through documentation.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <h6>Example data</h6>
            <p>Proposal: Create a demo inbox with example conversations so people can evaluate the product through self guided exploration.</p>
            <p>This would enable people to discover and interact with features and workflows to better understand the admin experience.</p>
            <p>Example conversations would give us an opportunity to bring out some of the magic of the Respond product. Through interviews with Sales and CS teammembers I learned that rich user profiles, gifs, emojis and the chat style UI help demonstrate the natural, personal feel that customers love.</p>

            <h6>Conclusion</h6>
            <p>Our solutions were very successful in testing, but a new company priority required our teams resources and we had to put the project on hold. Before pausing we scoped a v1 for final design and implementation.</p>
